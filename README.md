# Hello there!

I'm Emil, a developer from Finland.

I have always had a liking for programming, servers, networking etc. and as a hobby I currently run my own Proxmox-server at home to try and tinker around with different services. 

With programming I'm most interested in web service backend developement, API design and simplifying the architecture of current software systems. DevOps is also an aspect I'm keen on learning more about. I‚Äôm currently in process of creating my own simple Java library to collect some of the most needed common functionalities in the projects I've worked on so far into one neat package
